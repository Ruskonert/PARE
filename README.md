# PARE (Packet Assembly and Replay Engine)

The "PARE" originated in response to the evolving landscape of network security, recognizing the challenges and opportunities in the current environment. Network security constantly adapts to new threats and attacks, demanding tools that offer greater flexibility and effectiveness in handling network packet operations.

#### Increasing Customer Demands
Modern customers seek swift responses and flexible functionality from their network security solutions. Existing tools often fall short in meeting these demands, imposing constraints on developers and security professionals attempting to experiment and test freely. In response, the "PARE Project" aims to serve as a powerful and flexible network packet manipulation tool.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of the "PARE Project" include:

1. **Providing a More Flexible Experimental Environment:** Enabling security experts and developers to experiment and test network operations in various scenarios more easily.

2. **Rapid Response to Customer Requirements:** Addressing rapidly changing security demands by offering scalable features that can promptly meet diverse user needs.

3. **Overcoming Limitations of Existing Tools:** Mitigating the shortcomings of current tools by empowering users to generate, manipulate, and replay network packets more effectively.

### Problems Addressed
The "PARE Project" aims to solve the following issues:

1. **Lack of Flexibility:** Existing tools often operate within the constraints of specific protocols or scenarios. "PARE Project" supports flexible operations across various protocols and scenarios.

2. **Limitations in User Experience:** Developers require an intuitive environment for handling network packets and conducting experiments. "PARE Project" prioritizes user experience to lower entry barriers.

3. **More Accurate Simulations:** Existing tools face challenges in accurately simulating network operations. "PARE Project" addresses this by storing generated packets in PCAP files, enabling precise reproduction of network behaviors.

## Core Features
